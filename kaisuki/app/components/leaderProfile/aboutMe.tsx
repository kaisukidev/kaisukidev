      <p>
        I am a leader with 13 years of experience in
        technology, with 4 years solely in team leadership in the e-commerce
        industry. I am known for prioritizing the well-being of people while
        focusing on achieving company goals, inspiring and teaching many people
        throughout my career.
      </p>

      <p>
        Throughout my journey as a leader, I have constantly sought to improve
        myself and my teams, always aiming for high performance and exceeding
        targets. In this regard, some Brazilian books are references for me,
        such as Paulo Vieira&apos;s &quot;O Poder da Ação,&quot; Idalberto
        Chiavenato&apos;s &quot;Gestão de Pessoas,&quot; and Christian Barbosa&apos;s
        &quot;Gestão do Tempo.&quot;
      </p>

      <p>
        Additionally, I utilize methods such as OKRs, KPIs, and metrics to
        measure team results, ensuring that everyone is aligned with the
        company&apos;s goals and objectives. I also strive to work with
        multidisciplinary and diverse teams, allowing different perspectives to
        contribute to decision-making and problem-solving.
      </p>

      <p>
        My mission is to continue improving my leadership skills, helping my
        teams achieve high performance, and contributing to the development of
        e-commerce and technology.
